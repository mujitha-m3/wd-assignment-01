        <h1>How portable X-ray machines are helping remote patients</h1>

        <p><strong>Portable X-ray machines<i>"can literally be the difference between life and death"</i>, says radiographer
                Sam Pilkington.</strong></p>

        <p>For most of us, if we need to be X-rayed, the procedure is done in a hospital. But for acutely unwell patients,
            or for infection control, Miss Pilkington says that portable machines are very helpful.</p>

        <p>This is because <i>"they remove the excess burden of transportation from the patients"</i>, says the final-year student
            at the University of
            the West of England in Bristol, who is also a member of the Institute of Physics. Instead the X-ray equipment
            goes to them.</p>

        <p>There are obvious advantages for remote locations, including battlefields, roadsides, and disaster zones.</p>

        <p>And thanks to the increased availability - and ability - of such portable systems their usage is growing
            rapidly. With the
            coronavirus pandemic fueling <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9088417/">this increase</a>, the global 
            portable X-ray market was worth a reported <a href="https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/portable-x-ray-devices-market">$7.1bn(Â£5.6bn) 
            last year.</a> And this is expected to rise to $14bn by 2028.</p>

        <p>One remote place that has tested ultraportable X-ray hardware is the Orkney Islands in Scotland. Prior to a
            trial there from November
            2021 to January 2022, 73% of patients who were due for an X-ray did not attend their appointments - due in
            large part to the costs
            and time needed to reach distant hospitals.</p>
